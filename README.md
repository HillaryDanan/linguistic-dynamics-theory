## Overview

**Core Thesis:** Language functions as a control parameter in dynamical cognitive-behavioral systems, creating discrete branching points where trajectories diverge based on linguistic path history.

**Key Insight:** Just as calculus formalized continuous change and enabled physics/engineering, Linguistic Dynamics Theory formalizes how language shapes trajectories and enables systematic optimization of communication, education, therapy, and AI systems.

**Novel Contribution:** Unified framework explaining phenomena from adaptive testing to LLM prompt engineering to therapeutic reframing through single mechanistic principle.

## What This Framework Explains

- **Adaptive Testing:** Why identical ability produces different scores based on question sequence
- **Prompt Engineering:** Why same LLM produces dramatically different outputs based on prompt structure  
- **Therapeutic Change:** How linguistic reframing changes behavioral trajectories
- **Educational Scaffolding:** Why question order determines learning outcomes
- **Social Reality:** How speech acts literally create institutional facts
- **All through ONE mechanism:** Language as discrete control parameter in dynamical systems

---

## Framework Status

**Current Stage:** Theory formulation + experimental design

**Validation Status:** Working hypotheses with testable predictions

**Immediate Goal:** Execute experiments using LLM APIs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) as model systems

**Long-term Goal:** Develop "linguistic calculus" - systematic mathematics of language-as-control

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.9+
pip install anthropic openai google-generativeai
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running First Experiment
```bash
cd experiments/01_path_dependence
python run_experiment.py --model claude --trials 100
```

### Analyzing Results
```bash
cd analysis
python trajectory_measures.py --data ../experiments/01_path_dependence/results.json
```

## Core Principles

### 1. **Discretization**
Language imposes discrete structure on continuous cognitive spaces, creating finite branching points from infinite possibilities.

### 2. **Constraint**  
Linguistic framing activates subsets of cognitive operations, constraining available transformations.

### 3. **Bifurcation**
Critical linguistic inputs create path divergence where trajectories separate exponentially.

### 4. **Path Dependence**
History determines how systems respond to current inputs - same state + input ≠ same output if history differs.

### 5. **Information-Divergence Relationship**
Trajectory separation proportional to information content of linguistic inputs (entropy reduction).

---

## Experimental Predictions

### Testable Hypotheses:

**H1:** Identical LLM instances with different prompt histories produce significantly different responses to identical test prompts *(path dependence)*

**H2:** Linguistic category provision increases response clustering compared to unconstrained conditions *(discretization)*

**H3:** High-information prompts produce proportionally higher trajectory divergence than low-information prompts *(information-divergence)*

**H4:** Attractor strength (resistance to perturbation) increases with linguistic pattern repetition *(attractor formation)*

**H5:** Core effects generalize across LLM architectures (Claude, GPT, Gemini) *(cross-architecture)*

## Why This Matters

### Scientific Impact
- **Unifies disparate fields:** Linguistic relativity, dynamical systems, information theory, prompt engineering
- **Bridges human-AI cognition:** Same principles apply to brains and neural networks
- **Testable predictions:** Not philosophy - empirical science with falsifiable hypotheses
- **Novel formalism:** "Pre-calculus" stage for linguistic dynamics

### Practical Impact
- **Education:** Optimize question sequences for learning trajectories
- **Therapy:** Systematic linguistic interventions for behavioral change
- **AI Alignment:** Principled prompt engineering replacing trial-and-error
- **Communication:** Understanding how language shapes reality

### Philosophical Impact
- **Linguistic relativity vindicated** in dynamic form
- **Language as reality architecture** - not metaphor, mechanism
- **Speech acts generalized** - all language shapes trajectories
- **Human-AI convergence** on fundamental information processing principles
